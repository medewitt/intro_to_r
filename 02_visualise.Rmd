## Let's Chart!

The first analytic part of an analysis workflow is starting to visualise your data. This can be done with `ggplot2` which is one of the most powerful visualisation tools around (IMHO).

Let's do it with our gapminder dataset.

```{r}
ggplot( data = gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))+
  geom_line()
```

That really doesn't tell me anything...all of the countries are grouped together.

How could Improve the visualisation?

Let's group by countries!!

```{r}
ggplot( data = gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country))+
  geom_line()
```


Still a lot going on... let's break out each country!

```{r}
ggplot( data = gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country))+
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~continent)
```
